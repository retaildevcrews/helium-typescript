# Managed Identity and Key Vault with Node.js and Restify

> Build a Node.js and Restify Web API application using Managed Identity, Key Vault, and Cosmos DB that is designed to be deployed to Azure App Service or AKS as a Docker container.

![Docker Image Build](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium-typescript/workflows/Docker%20Image%20Build/badge.svg)

This is a Node.js and Restify Web API reference application designed to "fork and code" with the following features:

- Securely build, deploy and run an App Service (Web App for Containers) application
- Use Managed Identity to securely access resources
- Securely store secrets in Key Vault
- Securely build and deploy the Docker container from Container Registry
- Connect to and query CosmosDB
- Automatically send telemetry and logs to Azure Monitor

> Instructions for setting up Key Vault, ACR, Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB are in the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell (tested on Mac, Ubuntu, Windows with WSL2)
  - Will not work with WSL1
  - Will not work in Cloud Shell unless you have a remote dockerd
- Azure CLI ([download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest))
- Docker CLI ([download](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
- Node.js 12.14.1+ ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- npm 6.14.4+ (comes with Node.js)
- Visual Studio Code (optional) ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## Package Status

### Dependency Vulnerability

Currently, helium-typescript has a dependency on inversify-restify-utils which has a [vulnerability](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1171) (Regular Expression Denial of Service) due to a dependency on an older version of restify. This is being tracked in the appropriate github repo with [this issue](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS/issues/1158).

## Setup

- Fork this repo and clone to your local machine
  - All instructions assume starting from the root of the repo

### Build the container using Docker

- The unit tests run as part of the Docker build process. You can also run the unit tests manually using `npm test`, with watch using `npm run test:watch`, and with test coverage using `npm run test:coverage`.

- For instructions on building the container with ACR, please see the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
# build the image

docker build . -t helium-typescript -f Dockerfile

# note: you may see output like the following, this is expected and safe to ignore
# npm WARN gulp-debug@4.0.0 requires a peer of gulp@>=4 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
# npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@2.1.2 (node_modules/mocha/node_modules/fsevents):
# npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for fsevents@2.1.2: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})

# Tag and push the image to your Docker repo

```

### Run the application locally

- The application requires Key Vault and Cosmos DB to be setup per the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)
  - You can run the application locally by using Azure CLI cached credentials
    - You must run az login before this will work

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo

# log in with azure credentials (if not done already)

az login

# install modules in package.json file
# note: you may see output like the following, this is expected and safe to ignore
# npm WARN gulp-debug@4.0.0 requires a peer of gulp@>=4 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
# npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@2.1.2 (node_modules/mocha/node_modules/fsevents):
# npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for fsevents@2.1.2: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})

npm install

# build the app

npm run build

# run the app with command line args
# for local run, you need to specify CLI authentication type
# $He_Name is set to the name of your Key Vault

npm start -- --keyvault-name $He_Name --auth-type CLI

# optionally, set the logging level verboseness with --log-level (or -l)
# 'info' is the default
# please type --help for all options

npm start -- --keyvault-name $He_Name --auth-type CLI --log-level info

# alternatively you can set the following environment variables and run without command line args

export KEYVAULT_NAME=$He_Name
export AUTH_TYPE=CLI
export LOG_LEVEL=info # (optional)

npm start

# test the application
# the application takes about 10 seconds to start
# output should show pass or warn

curl http://localhost:4120/healthz
