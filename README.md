# Managed Identity and Key Vault with Node.js and Restify

> Build a Node.js and Restify Web API application using Managed Identity, Key Vault, and Cosmos DB that is designed to be deployed to Azure App Service or AKS as a Docker container.

![Docker Image Build](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium-typescript/workflows/Docker%20Image%20Build/badge.svg)

This is a Node.js and Restify Web API reference application designed to "fork and code" with the following features:

- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure App Service (Web App for Containers) application
- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) application
- Use Managed Identity to securely access resources
- Securely store secrets in Key Vault
- Securely build and deploy the Docker container to Azure Container Registry (ACR) or Docker Hub
- Connect to and query Cosmos DB
- Automatically send telemetry and logs to Azure Monitor

> Visual Studio Codespaces is the easiest way to evaluate helium as all of the prerequisites are automatically installed
>
> Follow the setup steps in the [Helium readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium) to setup Codespaces

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell (tested on Visual Studio Codespaces, Mac, Ubuntu, Windows with WSL2)
  - Will not work with WSL1 or Cloud Shell
- Azure CLI ([download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest))
- Docker CLI ([download](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
- Node.js 12.14.1+ ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- npm 6.14.4+ (comes with Node.js)
- Visual Studio Code (optional) ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## Setup

- Initial setup instructions are in the [Helium readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)
  - Please complete the setup steps and then continue below

### Validate az CLI works

> In Visual Studio Codespaces, open a terminal by pressing ctl + `

```bash

# make sure you are logged into Azure
az account show

# if not, log in
az login

```

### Verify Key Vault Access

```bash

# verify you have access to Key Vault
az keyvault secret show --name CosmosDatabase --vault-name $He_Name

```

### Using Visual Studio Codespaces

- Open `launch.json` in the `.vscode` directory
- Replace `{your key vault name}` with the name of your key vault
  - the file saves automatically
- Press F5
- Wait for `Debugger attached` in the Debug Console
- Skip to the testing step below

### Using bash shell

> This will work from a terminal in Visual Studio Codespaces as well

```bash

# install modules in package.json file
# note: you may see output like the following, this is expected and safe to ignore
# npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@2.1.3 (node_modules/chokidar/node_modules/fsevents):
# npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for fsevents@2.1.3: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})
# npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@1.2.13 (node_modules/fsevents):
# npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for fsevents@1.2.13: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})

npm install

# build the app

npm run build

# run the app with command line args
# for local run, you need to specify CLI authentication type and set the dev flag
# $He_Name is set to the name of your Key Vault

npm start -- --keyvault-name $He_Name --auth-type CLI --dev

# optionally, set the logging level verboseness with --log-level (or -l)
# 'info' is the default
# please type --help for all options

npm start -- --keyvault-name $He_Name --auth-type CLI --log-level info --dev

# alternatively you can set the following environment variables and run without command line args

export KEYVAULT_NAME=$He_Name
export AUTH_TYPE=CLI # requires the dev flag be set
export LOG_LEVEL=info # (optional)

npm start -- --dev

```

wait for `Server is listening on port 4120`

### Testing the application

Open a new bash shell

> Visual Studio Codespaces allows you to open multiple shells by clicking on the `Split Terminal` icon

```bash

# test the application

# test using httpie (installed automatically in Codespaces)
http localhost:4120/version

# test using curl
curl localhost:4120/version

```

Stop helium by typing Ctrl-C or the stop button if run via F5

### Deep Testing

We use [Web Validate](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/webvalidate) to run deep verification tests on the Web API

If you have dotnet core sdk installed

```bash

# install Web Validate as a dotnet global tool
# this is automatically installed in CodeSpaces
dotnet tool install -g webvalidate

# make sure you are in the root of the repository

# run the validation tests
# validation tests are located in the TestFiles directory
cd TestFiles

webv -s localhost:4120 -f baseline.json

# there may be a validation error on the /healthz/ietf endpoint test
#   json: status: warn : Expected: pass
# the "warn" status indicates a slower than normal response time
# this is OK and will occasionally occur

# bad.json tests error conditions that return 4xx codes

# benchmark.json is a 300 request test that covers the entire API

# cd to root of repo
cd ..

```

Test using Docker image

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repository

# run the validation tests
# mount the local TestFiles directory to /app/TestFiles in the container
# 172.17.0.1 is the docker host IP
docker run -it --rm -v TestFiles:/app/TestFiles retaildevcrew/webvalidate -s http://172.17.0.1:4120 -f baseline.json

# there may be a validation error on the /healthz/ietf endpoint test
#   json: status: warn : Expected: pass
# the "warn" status indicates a slower than normal response time
# this is OK and will occasionally occur

# bad.json tests error conditions that return 4xx codes

# benchmark.json is a 300 request test that covers the entire API

```

## Build the release container using Docker

> A release build requires MSI to connect to Key Vault.

- The unit tests run as part of the Docker build process. You can also run the unit tests manually using `npm test`, with watch using `npm run test:watch`, and with test coverage using `npm run test:coverage`.

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
# build the image

docker build . -t helium-typescript

# note: you may see output like the following, this is expected and safe to ignore
# npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@2.1.3 (node_modules/chokidar/node_modules/fsevents):
# npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for fsevents@2.1.3: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})
# npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@1.2.13 (node_modules/fsevents):
# npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for fsevents@1.2.13: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})


# Tag and push the image to your Docker repo

```

## CI-CD

> Make sure to fork the repo before experimenting with CI-CD

This repo uses [GitHub Actions](/.github/workflows/dockerCI.yml) for Continuous Integration.

- CI supports pushing to Azure Container Registry or DockerHub
- The action is setup to execute on a PR or commit to ```master```
  - The action does not run on commits to branches other than ```master```
- The action always publishes an image with the ```:beta``` tag
- If you tag the repo with a version i.e. ```v1.0.8``` the action will also
  - Tag the image with ```:1.0.8```
  - Tag the image with ```:stable```
  - Note that the ```v``` is case sensitive (lower case)
- Once the `secrets` below are set, create a new branch, make a change to a file (md file changes are ignored), commit and push your change, create a PR into your local master
- Check the `Actions` tab on the GitHub repo main page

CD is supported via webhooks in Azure App Services connected to the ACR or DockerHub repository.

### CI to Azure Container Registry

In order to push to ACR, you set the following `secrets` in your GitHub repo:

- Azure Login Information
  - TENANT
  - SERVICE_PRINCIPAL
  - SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET

- ACR Information
  - ACR_REG
  - ACR_REPO
  - ACR_IMAGE

### CI to DockerHub

In order to push to DockerHub, you must set the following `secrets` in your GitHub repo:

- DOCKER_REPO
- DOCKER_USER
- DOCKER_PAT
  - Personal Access Token (recommended) or password
