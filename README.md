# [Work in Progress] Build a Docker containerized, secure Node.js Web API application using Managed Identity, Key Vault, and Cosmos DB that is designed to be deployed to Azure App Service or AKS

This sample is a Node.JS REST WebAPI application designed to "fork and code" with the following features:

- Securely build, deploy and run an App Service (Web App for Containers) application
- Use Managed Identity to securely access resources
- Securely store secrets in Key Vault
- Securely build and deploy the Docker container from Container Registry or Azure DevOps
- Connect to and query CosmosDB
- Automatically send telemetry and logs to Azure Monitor
- Instructions for setting up Key Vault, ACR, Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB are in the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI 2.0.72+ ([download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest))
- Docker CLI ([download](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
- JQ ([download](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/))
- Visual Studio Code (optional) ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- TODO: Add other prerequisites for running app

## Setup

- Fork this repo and clone to your local machine
  - All instructions assume starting from the root of the repo

Build the container using Docker

- The unit tests run as part of the Docker build process. You can also run the unit tests manually. (TODO: Create Unit Tests)
- For instructions on building the container with ACR, please see the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
# build the image
docker build -t helium-node -f Dockerfile

# Tag and push the image to your Docker repo

```

Run the application locally

- The application requires Key Vault and Cosmos DB to be setup per the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo

# run the app
npm run build
npm start

# test the application
# the application takes about 10 seconds to start
curl http://localhost:4120/healthz

```

Run the application as a local container instead

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
# docker-dev builds an alpine image with Azure CLI installed in the container
docker build -t helium-dev -f Dockerfile-Dev .

# run the container
# mount your ~/.azure directory to container root/.azure directory
# you can also run the container and run az login from a bash shell
docker run -d -p 4120:4120 -e KeyVaultName=$He_Name --name helium-dev -v ~/.azure:/root/.azure helium-dev "npm" "start"

# check the logs
# re-run until the application started message appears
docker logs helium-dev

# curl the health check endpoint
curl http://localhost:4120/healthz

# Stop and remove the container
docker stop helium-dev
docker rm helium-dev

```
